## Instructions
* Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
  * The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person 
    both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
  * The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
    * ``BMI Formula: (weight (in kg)) / (height (in m) * height (in m) )``


* Warning you should convert the result to a whole number.
  * Example Input
    ```
    weight = 80
    height = 1.75
    ```
  * Example Output
    ```
    80 รท (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837
    26
    ```
    
### Hint
1. Check the data type of the inputs.
2. Try to use the exponent operator in your code.
3. Remember PEMDAS.
4. Remember to convert your result to a whole number (int).
